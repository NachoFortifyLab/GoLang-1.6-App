# Use this workflow template as a basis for integrating Fortify on Demand Static Application Security Testing (SAST) into your GitHub workflows.#
# This template demonstrates the steps to check if an application exists in your Fortify On Demand Tenant, create it if it's not exists,        #
# Configure the static scan options the application is new, prepare the code and dependencies, initiate a scan,                                 #
# Download results once complete and import the results into GitHub Security Code Scanning Alerts.                                              #                                      
# Existing customers should review inputs and environment variables below to configure scanning against                                         #
# an existing application in your Fortify on Demand tenant. Additional information is available in the comments throughout the workflow, the    #
# documentation for the Fortify actions used, and the Fortify on Demand / ScanCentral Client product documentation which is located at          #
